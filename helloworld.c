#include <stdio.h> // Include the standard input/output library. This provides functions like printf for printing to the console.
#include <stdlib.h> // Include the standard library. While not strictly necessary for this *particular* code, it's often included as a good practice, as it contains various utility functions (like memory allocation, process control, etc.) that you might use in more complex programs.

int main() { // The main function is the entry point of every C program.  Execution begins here.
    printf("Hello world!\n"); // Print the string "Hello world!" to the console.  \n is the newline character, which moves the cursor to the next line after printing.
    return 0; // Return 0 to indicate that the program executed successfully.  A return value of 0 is a convention used to signal that no errors occurred.
