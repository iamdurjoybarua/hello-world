# Hello World in C

This repository contains a simple C program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.  It's a classic introductory programming exercise, often used to verify that a development environment is correctly set up.

## Description

The `hello.c` program utilizes the standard input/output library (`stdio.h`) and its `printf` function to display the message.  It's a basic example demonstrating the fundamental structure of a C program.

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Save the code:** Save the code as `hello.c`.

2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and use a C compiler (like GCC) to compile the code:

   ```bash
   gcc hello.c -o hello
